[abstract]
You can balance performance against consistency in N1QL queries via the Couchbase Python client and the AtPlus option.

Setting a https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.1/architecture/querying-data-with-n1ql.html#story-h2-2[Scan Consistency^], lets you choose between `NOT_BOUNDED` (the default), for sharpest performance; `REQUEST_PLUS`, for strongest consistency; and `AT_PLUS`, for a good balance between increased performance and completeness of results.

The following example -- for which mutation tokens must be enabled during connection -- shows AT_PLUS in action, using `consistentWith(MutationState)`:

#!/usr/bin/env python
import time

from couchbase.bucket import Bucket
from couchbase.n1ql import N1QLQuery, MutationState

TIMESTAMP = str(time.time())

cb = Bucket('couchbase://localhost/default?fetch_mutation_tokens=true')
rv = cb.upsert('ndoc', {'timestamp': TIMESTAMP})

ms = MutationState()
ms.add_results(rv)

query = N1QLQuery('SELECT * from default WHERE timestamp=$1', TIMESTAMP)
query.consistent_with(ms)
print query.encoded

for row in cb.n1ql_query(query):
    print row
