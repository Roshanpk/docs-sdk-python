= Install and Start Using the Python SDK with Couchbase Server

:navtitle: Start Using the SDK

[abstract]
The Couchbase Python SDK allows Python applications to access a Couchbase cluster.
The Python SDK offers a traditional synchronous API as well as integration with _twisted_, _gevent_, and _asyncio_.
It depends on the C SDK, libcouchbase, which it uses for performance and reliability.




TIP: Owing to the evolution of the Python language, API, and compiler over time, we support an optimal subset of Python platforms. 
Please see xref:compatibility-versions-features.adoc#platform-compatibility[the Compatibility page] for details.


== Requirements

First, you will need to install libcouchbase.

See https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client/blob/release25/README.rst#prerequisites to see the minimum version you will require.
The latest patch release of libcouchbase 2.10 should always be fine with the latest Python 2.5 SDK.

Install the latest compatible version of libcouchbase, following the instructions xref:2.10@c-sdk::sdk-release-notes.adoc[here].
Note that the Windows installation handles this automatically.

The Couchbase Python SDK 2.5 will run any any version of Python above 2.7 or 3.5 
(Python 3.x only on Windows -- with 3.6 and above strongly recommended, in order to ensure libcouchbase and the compiled C bindings are automatically installed via Python wheel, rather than requiring manual installation/compilation).

Other prerequisites will depend upon your Operating System platform.

Once libcouchbase is installed, please follow the instructions specific to your platform, _below_:

* xref:#installing-on-linux[GNU/Linux]
* xref:#installing-on-mac-os-x[MacOS-X]
* xref:#installing-on-microsoft-windows[MS Windows]


== Installing on Linux

.Debian and Ubuntu
[source,bash]
----
# Only needed during first-time setup:
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip
sudo -H pip install couchbase
----

.RHEL and CentOS
[source,bash]
----

# Only needed during first-time setup:
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ python-devel python-pip
sudo -H pip install couchbase
----

NOTE: RHEL/CentOS distributions may not provide the `python-pip` package in the base repositories.
It may be found in the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL[EPEL^] repository.

== Installing on Mac OS X

As with the Linux installation, first install libcouchbase (LCB) following the instructions xref:2.10@c-sdk::sdk-release-notes.adoc[here].
For Mac OS X, first install the _de facto_ package manager for OS X: http://brew.sh/[homebrew^].
Once _homebrew_ is configured:

[source,console]
----
brew update # get list of latest packages
brew install libcouchbase@2
brew install python
pip install couchbase
----

NOTE: The above example uses the Python supplied by homebrew and not the vendor-supplied Python which ships with OS X.
The Python SDK will still work with the vendor-supplied Python (though _pip install_ may be a privileged command), but it is recommended to use Homebrew's Python instead.

The libcouchbase and python installations can both be combined, adding LCB to the brew install step for the homebrew version of Python, before installing the Python SDK with pip:

[source,console]
----
brew install libcouchbase@2 python
pip install couchbase
----

See the xref:2.10@c-sdk::start-using-sdk.adoc#install-osx[LCB installation pages] if you have more complex requirements.

== Installing on Microsoft Windows

The Couchbase Python SDK is available as an executable installer for Windows.
This contains all the required dependencies, including C SDK development files.

[source,bash]
----
pip install couchbase
----


== Hello Couchbase

The code snippet below shows how the Python SDK may be used for some common operations.

[source,python]
----
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
from couchbase.cluster import PasswordAuthenticator
cluster = Cluster('couchbase://localhost')
authenticator = PasswordAuthenticator('username', 'password')
cluster.authenticate(authenticator)
cb = cluster.open_bucket('bucket-name')
cb.upsert('u:king_arthur', {'name': 'Arthur', 'email': 'kingarthur@couchbase.com', 'interests': ['Holy Grail', 'African Swallows']})
# OperationResult<RC=0x0, Key=u'u:king_arthur', CAS=0xb1da029b0000>

cb.get('u:king_arthur').value
# {u'interests': [u'Holy Grail', u'African Swallows'], u'name': u'Arthur', u'email': u'kingarthur@couchbase.com'}

## The CREATE PRIMARY INDEX step is only needed the first time you run this script
cb.n1ql_query('CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON bucket-name').execute()
from couchbase.n1ql import N1QLQuery
row_iter = cb.n1ql_query(N1QLQuery('SELECT name FROM bucket-name WHERE ' +\
'$1 IN interests', 'African Swallows'))
for row in row_iter: print(row)
# {u'name': u'Arthur'}
----

== Connecting

To connect to a Couchbase bucket, you must use Couchbase _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC).
This is fully described in the section xref:6.0@server:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].
An _authenticator_, containing username and password, should be defined, and then passed to the cluster.
Following successful authentication, the bucket can be opened.

[source,python]
----
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
from couchbase.cluster import PasswordAuthenticator
cluster = Cluster('couchbase://localhost')
authenticator = PasswordAuthenticator('username', 'password')
cluster.authenticate(authenticator)
bucket = cluster.open_bucket('bucket-name')
----

Once defined, the authenticator can be passed to other clusters, as appropriate.

See xref:managing-connections.adoc[Managing Connections Using the Python SDK with Couchbase Server] for more connection options and details about the connection string.

IMPORTANT: Any Cluster nodes addresses passed in to establish (bootstrap) the connection should be for data (KV) nodes.

== Document Operations

xref:core-operations.adoc[Document operations], such as storing and retrieving documents, can be done using simple methods on the [.api]`Bucket` class such as [.api]`Bucket.get` and [.api]`Bucket.upsert`.
Simply pass the key (and value, if applicable) to the relevant methods.

[source,python]
----
rv = bucket.get('document-id')
print(rv.value)
----

[source,python]
----
bucket.upsert('document-id', {'application': 'data'})
----

== N1QL Queries

Couchbase N1QL queries are performed by creating a [.api]`N1QLQuery` object and passing that to the [.api]`Bucket.n1ql_query()` method:

[source,python]
----
from couchbase.n1ql import N1QLQuery
query = N1QLQuery("""SELECT airportname, city, country FROM `travel-sample` """
                  """WHERE type="airport" AND city=$my_city""", my_city="Reno")
for row in bucket.n1ql_query(query):
    print(row)
----

== API Reference

The API reference is generated for each release and can be found linked from the xref:sdk-release-notes.adoc[release notes for your version of the Python SDK].
The _latest_ version's API reference can be found https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-python-client/[here^].
Most of the API documentation can also be accessed via `pydoc`.

== Release Notes

Information on new features, fixes, known issues as well as information on how to install older release versions is xref:sdk-release-notes.adoc[in the release notes].

== PyPy support

Because the Python SDK is written primarily in C using the CPython API, the official SDK will not work on PyPy.

An unofficial module, https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-python-cffi[couchbase_ffi^] uses ffi rather than the CPython C API to implement the internals of the library, and may be used with pypy.
